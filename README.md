A Password manager

When I started working on computers in the late 70's, we were told to "Never, ever, ever write your password down!" 

Of course, it was easy back then.  You only ever had 1 or two passwords, for work or school.

Things are a little different today, and to say I may have 50 passwords is a good guess (although I know some are for websites that have gone away, so probably don't count).  So a new method of keeping track of passwords has been developed, the password manager.  My password manager probably doesn't have all the bells and whistles others have.  But it has no malware, no ads, and if you are paranoid, you can look over the code yourself and see that it is clean.

Use it in good health, and remember, it is free, and should not be sold.

Some notes:
This is a Python program.  To run it, you must have Python installed on your computer.  You also need the PySimpleGUI Python library installed.

Once they are installed, open a terminal (in Linus), or a CMD window (in Windows).  I believe it will also run on a Mac, but do not have one available to me to test it.

After getting Python and PySimpleGUI installed, download lockbox.py and lockboxHelp.py, and run
python lockbox.py

Enjoy.
